# COVID-19-Corona-Forecasting-using-Machine-Learning
The example trains a Machine Learning Model to forecast the number of covid-19 cases given the number of cases in previous days.
Corona contains a single time series, with time steps corresponding to days and values corresponding to the number of cases. The output is a column array, where each element is a single time step. For the forecastive model we require confirmed cases data only of everyday. But for analysis you require COVID-19 data of every state on daily basis.
